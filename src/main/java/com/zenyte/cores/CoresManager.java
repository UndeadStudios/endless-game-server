/**
 * The CoresManager is responsbile for initializing thread behaviour.
 *
 * The key things to remember about the game engine are as follows:<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The main thread handles game-tick based tasks, such as {@code WorldTask}s and general game actions. Therefore, if performing a scheduled
 * or delayed execution based on game ticks, use the {@code WorldTasksManager.schedule(...)} approach.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code slowExecutor} manages a pool of threads dedicated to running either continuously repeated tasks, or
 * {@link FixedLengthRunnable} objects. In either of these cases, the frequency of the {@code run()} call is not bound to game ticks - it
 * runs for the specified interval with a specified time unit.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code fastExecutor} manages a pool of threads dedicated to running single-execution {@link Runnable}s immediately after they are
 * submitted for exeuction. Like the {@code slowExecutor}, the start delay of the {@code run()} call is not bound to game ticks - it will
 * run as soon as the thread pool supplies a thread to run it.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * "then it (the {@code fastExecutor}) shouldn't carry the downfalls of the timer based system. "<br/>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     - Noele, when (indirectly) talking about the inconsistencies
 *       of mixing threading APIs in a fully multi-threaded system.
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * Exactly! But, with the way we have implemented it, it (the {@code fastExecutor}) doesn't! The underlying thread pool executor objects
 * ({@code slowExecuter} and {@code fastExecutor}) are of a different type; one is a subclass of a {@link ScheduledExecutorService}
 * ({@code slowExecuter}) and the other is a subclasss of {@link ExecutorService} ({@code fastExecutor}).<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code fastExecutor} can only call {@code execute(Runnable r)}, {@code call(Callable c)}, and {@code submit(Runnable r)}, all of
 * which do the same thing: run a {@link Runnable} once and only once, and as soon as a thread is supplied from the thread pool.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code slowExecuter} also has {@code execute(Runnable r)}, but also has things like {@code schedule(...)},
 * {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay(...)}, ... , which allow it to repeat tasks, or start tasks after a delay.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * These methods might be common knowledge, but it is important to stress the fundamental reason that both the {@code slowExecuter} and
 * {@code fastExecutor} exist; each has a separate thread pool maintaining them. Unique thread pools mapped to a unique type of threaded
 * service. Good for organization, good for resource management.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * Furthermore, with the {@link ServiceProvider}, all of this functionality is wrapped in a class which is responsible for choosing the
 * correct executor service to use.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * For those of you TL;DR nerds: we no longer use a {@link java.util.Timer} object for the {@code fastExecutor}, as its functionality will
 * be deprecated in Java 9, and quite frankly, because it is ancient history when compared to the {@code Executors} framework. We instead
 * use a custom manager called a {@code ServiceProvider} to use the executor services.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * What you used to do with a {@code TimerTask}:<br/>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     CoresManager.fastExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTask {
 *     		int someStuff;
 *     		boolean stop;
 *
 *     		public void run() { if(stop) cancel(); }
 *
 *     }, delay, freq);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * What we do with the {@link ServiceProvider}
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CoresManager.getServiceProvider().scheduleFixedLengthTask(new FixedLengthRunnable() {
 * 	boolean stop;
 *
 * 	public boolean repeat() {
 * 		// do logic
 * 		if (someCondition)
 * 			stop = true;
 * 		else
 * 			stop = false;
 * 		return stop;
 * 	}
 * }, 0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 * </pre>
